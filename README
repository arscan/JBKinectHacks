JBKinectHacks
=============

A collection of sample projects and code snippets using OpenNI and the Kinect.
Only tested on OSX.

Each sample project should work on its own, assuming you have libOpenNI.dylib
installed in /usr/lib and the OpenNI includes in /usr/include/ni. To start a
new sample project, just copy one of the directories and start hacking!

To Install OpenNI for Mac
-------------------------
# Get OpenNI
git clone git://github.com/OpenNI/OpenNI.git

# Switch to unstable branch (only unstable supports osx atm)

# Get the unstable forked version of the PrimeSense/Sensor module working
git clone git://github.com/ros-pkg-git/Sensor.git
