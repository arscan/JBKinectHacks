JBKinectHacks
=============

A collection of sample projects and code snippets using OpenNI and the Kinect.
Only tested on OSX.

To build using the included makefiles, libOpenNI.dylib must be
installed in /usr/lib and the OpenNI includes must be in /usr/include/ni.

To build using the xcode project, you must symlink /usr/include/ni and
/usr/lib/libOpenNI.dylib to the appropriate places in your developer install.
AFAIK there's not an elegant way to get xcode to use the standard /usr/include
and /usr/lib paths. For my installation I ran the following commands:

sudo ln -s /usr/lib/libOpenNI.dylib /Developer/SDKs/MacOSX10.6.sdk/usr/lib/libOpenNI.dylib

sudo ln -s /usr/include/ni /Developer/SDKs/MacOSX10.6.sdk/usr/include/ni

Note that the binaries expect a file named SamplesConfig.xml to be in the present working
directory when they are run.

To Install OpenNI for Mac
-------------------------
# Get OpenNI
git clone git://github.com/OpenNI/OpenNI.git

# Switch to unstable branch (only unstable supports osx atm)
git checkout unstable

# Follow the installation instructions in the Readme (they're pretty good)

# Get the unstable forked version of the PrimeSense/Sensor module working
git clone git://github.com/ros-pkg-git/Sensor.git

# Follow the installation instructions in the Readme (they're also pretty good)

# Get the PrimeSense NITE binaries here:
http://www.openni.org/component/search/?searchword=nite&ordering=&searchphrase=all

# Run the install script included with the NITE binaries
sudo ./install.sh

# Use License code
